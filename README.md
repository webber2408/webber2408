### Hi there 👋, I'm Rahul, a Software Developer by profession and an eager learner from the heart.

It's great to have you here! Do checkout my latest activities and pinned repositories, gists! 

My introduction to the Computer Science field was made during my inquisitive childhood years, where I was curious to understand how my favorite 'fly-on click helicopter 🚁' game worked!

Ever since then, I dreamt of diving deep into this field and here I am building scalable and optimized web portals.
